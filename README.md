DATABASE SCHEMA CREATE DATABASE judge;

USE judge;

CREATE TABLE judges ( judgeId VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL );

CREATE TABLE users ( userId VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY, userName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, Score INT DEFAULT 0 );


 Design Choices Explained
    1. Database Structure
    The database was designed with simplicity and clarity to support user evaluation functionality. Two primary tables are used:

    a) judges table
    sql
    Copy
    Edit
    CREATE TABLE judges (
    judgeId VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );
    judgeId is the unique identifier for each judge.

    Passwords are stored (though ideally should be hashed using password_hash() for security).

    Structure supports login and authorization features in the future.

    b) users table
    sql
    Copy
    Edit
    CREATE TABLE users (
    userId VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    userName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Score INT DEFAULT 0
    );
    Stores participants' details and their cumulative scores.

    The Score field supports multiple additions from different judges.

    This simple schema avoids complexity and is easy to maintain, making it suitable for a small to medium-sized judging platform.

    2. PHP Constructs
    âœ… mysqli_real_escape_string()
    Used to sanitize user inputs before inserting into the database to prevent SQL injection.

    âœ… isset($_POST['...'])
    Used to check if a form submission was made before running insert or update logic. This helps ensure that scripts respond only to valid POST requests.

    âœ… header("Location: ...")
    Used for redirection after successful or failed operations, providing feedback through query parameters.

    âœ… HTML & PHP Mixed
    PHP is embedded inside HTML to dynamically display data like users and form values. This makes it simple to render database results directly on the frontend.

    âœ… Modal Popups with JavaScript
    Used a JavaScript modal to collect scores, which makes the experience more interactive and avoids page reloads before submitting.

    3. Design Decisions
    Modularity: Code is separated into functional files like functions/function.php and modal/assignPoints.php to improve maintainability.

    Tailwind CSS: Used for a clean, modern UI without writing a lot of custom CSS.

    Score Validation: Scores are restricted to a range (1â€“100) using both JavaScript and PHP to ensure data integrity.

ðŸ”§ Assumptions Made
    All judges have unique usernames and IDs.

    Scores are integers between 1 and 100.

    Thereâ€™s no authentication or session tracking for judges in this version.

    A score is cumulative (added to any existing score for the user).



ðŸš€ Features to Add (If Given More Time) âœ… Judge login/logout system with session handling.

âœ… Score history and audit trail.

âœ… Prevent scoring the same user multiple times.

âœ… Export user scores to CSV or PDF.

âœ…Better UI/UX.

âœ… Admin dashboard for managing judges and users.
